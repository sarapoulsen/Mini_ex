**Mini exercise 7 - Dig it?**
By Sara Poulsen and Mette Mark SÃ¸rensen 

Our program is a page with seven lines of text that becomes gradually brighter down the lines. The lines sort of form a poem, and this poem is randomly generated from 7-8 existing sentences that is found in the text file dig_it.txt. We used the lyrics from the second verse of the song Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts by Funkadelic. When you click the mouse, the program shuffles the order of the sentences, and a new poem is generated. Whenever you make a new poem by clicking the mouse, the program sort of communicates to you and asks you if you like the poem by saying "Dig it?". 

The syntaxes that make this code excecute are quite simple; actually we only need 24 lines of source code for the code to execute, to work as it should. However, we wanted to work more with the source code and change it in a way that would not have any effect on the executing code - so something that exists is in the code but is not visible unless you read through the source code. We implemented the entire lyrics of the song by Funkadelic that I spoke of earlier, and as a result our source code consists of 91 lines instead of just 24. A major part of the source code has now become unreadable by the computer - most of the source code is really directed to humans and is not meant to be understood by a computer.

In relation to this weeks' text, 'Vocable Code', the program kind of explores this phenomena that code's primary purpose is to be executed by a computer, and only secondarily to be understood by a human. We wanted to challenge this view, because at least for me I find it very interesting that something can be "hidden" in code. "... the program interpreter only listens to the program and not the programmer" (p. 23 in Vocable Code). Now, the programmer actually might have an agenda that is only visible if you go to look at the actual source code - in this case, for our program, the "hidden" lines exist to further expand the message of the song that is delivered to the user. 

Another interesting perspective is the fact that the program speaks to us - due to this being a very simple program, we are not able to reply, and the program is certainly not able to form another reply that fits the situation of the user. In a way this sort of highlights the difference between spoken language and code and how code should follow some very strict rules to even be able to execute - it removes the randomnes and spontaneity and  that is often found in spoken language.
