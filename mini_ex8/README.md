**Mini exercise 8 - CHEERS**
By Sara Poulsen and Ida Br√§uner

The program uses the open weather API which is also incorporated in an example by Daniel Shiffman (one of the videos we watched for this week). We used the weather data from four different European cities and chose to show the temperature. The temperature is shown through the amount of beverages in the glasses. We have used an if-statement to determine how full the glasses should be, according to the temperatures in concern - a high temperature equals a fuller glass while a low temperature equals a glass that is not so full. We have chosen to set the lowest temperature to less than -10 degrees and the highest temperature to more than 20 degrees. Then we have divided it into five levels, so each level consists of 10 degrees. To make it more precise, we could have chosen to create more levels.

Notice that the link does not work as it should - probably because Github is not able to access the open weather API that we used. The first screenshot shows the program when it is working; here we see Moscow, Copenhagen and Paris having a temperature between 10-20 degrees celsius, and London having between 0-10 degrees celsius.
