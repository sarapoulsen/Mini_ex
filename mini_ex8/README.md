**Mini exercise 8 - CHEERS**
By Sara Poulsen and Ida Br√§uner

The program uses the open weather API which is also incorporated in an example by Daniel Shiffman (one of the videos we watched for this week). We used the weather data from four different European cities and chose to show the temperature. The temperature is shown through the amount of beverages in the glasses. We have used an if-statement to determine how full the glasses should be, according to the temperatures in concern - a high temperature equals a fuller glass while a low temperature equals a glass that is not so full. We have chosen to set the lowest temperature to less than -10 degrees and the highest temperature to more than 20 degrees. Then we have divided it into five levels, so each level consists of 10 degrees. To make it more precise, we could have chosen to create more levels.

Notice that the link does not work as it should - probably because Github is not able to access the open weather API that we used. The first screenshot shows the program when it is working; here we see Moscow, Copenhagen and Paris having a temperature between 10-20 degrees celsius, and London having between 0-10 degrees celsius.

**My thoughts**
In the beginning of the process of making this program, we had a different idea of how it should turn out than how it actually did. We initially wanted to do something with statistics that would change rapidly, like for instance get some data that could tell whenever a baby was born. We weren't able to find an API with this sort of data that we could access for free, so we ended up doing something different (and also easier) by using the weather example that Daniel Shiffman demonstrates. The program now has a sort of fun approach - the amount of liquid in the glasses indicate how good the weather is, so if the weather is good in Copenhagen for instance, you should grab a large beer. 

Obviously it was frustrating not being able to acquire the actual data that we wanted, and we had to come up with a new idea that could fit the weather data instead. There were some positive sides to it though, since acquiring the weather data was really easy. We downloaded a Chrome extension called a JSON Formatter, so the data that we got from the web API was quite transparent in the way that it was easy to locate the data that we wanted to use. I imagine that this API is easily accessible compared to many other places on the web, where the data could be much more encrypted and difficult to read. 

Working with APIs and querying processes has got me thinking of how difficult it really is to access data from different websites. It would be interesting to look more into like, what websites have their APIs easily accesible, and what websites or big companies recquire more effort, time and maybe money if you want to access their data.
