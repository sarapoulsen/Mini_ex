## Mini exercise 9

### **Individual work**

I chose to make a flowchart of my mini exercise number 6 - this is from the week that was mainly focused on the subject of generativity. It was difficult to determine how simple or detailed I wanted my flowchart to be; the program that I chose actually has quite a simple output, but i found that it was also an interesting program as it is one that generates itself over time. In this way it must have some loops. I have a 'descision' box in my flowchart stating that the program should check if the mouse is press. If the answer is yes, the program draws or prints a circle at the position of the mouse. If the answer is no, nothing happens - I didn't know wether to put the 'no' option in my flowchart, or if I should've just left it out. Also I noticed that i mainly focused on the moving functions of the program and for instance not the static gradient background and how that is created.

### **Group work**

Flowchart 1: Grab them by the pussy - Pussy Grabs Back

We want to create a game that focuses on the #metoo movement. Our plan is to create a game where the player is a Pussycat that is trying to defeat all the misogynist and sexist men. The men are going to be objects that are meant to portray some of the famous men that are known for having sexist opinions or in other ways have offended women. The idea is that the pussy grabs back by eating the men in the game. The men-objects are falling down from the top line of the canvas, and as the game continues and the Pussycat eats the men, the speed of the men falling from the topline increases, so it will become more challenging for the pussycat to eat the men. If the pussycat misses on, the game is over. The reason we haven’t created it with more than one life, is to emphasize how important it is to stay woke and let no sexist go free. 
We have also chosen to create an end on the game, so when the pussycat has eaten all of the sexists she has won the game.

Flowchart 2: Stay woke

We want to create a program that illustrates the growing level of pollution. We want to show this by getting data from an API, so when the level of pollution increases, an image of a so called “garbage-island” increases in size as well. Besides from this we want to bring in data through a different API (such as New York Times), to show some relevant news on the topic pollution. We have also discussed the idea of the garbage-island being made up of pictures of pollution or animals dying as a consequence of the pollution. This would perhaps require getting data from yet another API. Through this project we hope to have an affect on the user and make people aware of how important and urgent this issue is. We want to say: Hello world. Wake up, act now!

**What might be the possible technical challenges for the two ideas and how are you going to solve them?**
In the first project “Pussy Grabs Back”, some of the possible technical challenges could be how we would manage to code an increase of speed of the objects (the sexists) in the game, and perhaps also how to code the action of the two objects as in “the pussycat” and “the sexists” and how they react towards each other, when they are in contact. The solution could be to research other games with the same objective and examine the code.

In our second project, we want to use two different API’s; one that collects the headlines of news articles that focuses on pollution and the consequences we see in the world around us; and a second one that contains exact numbers and data regarding the topic of pollution. A technical challenge here will definitely be to, first of all find API’s with this sort of data that we are able to access, and secondly, we might encounter some problems when uploading the program (just like how the security around the weather API we used for mini_ex8 prevented our programs from executing as they should). 
Another technical difficulty will occur when the API-data increases - we have to be very calculated in terms of how much the “garbage island” should grow. This probably requires some experimenting in terms of investigating how much the level of pollution actually grows, and how we can reflect and put emphasis on this in our program.
